# Basic-Coding-Quiz
## Description

In this project we created a quiz to test basic Javascript knowledge and used JS to allow the user to answer multiple choice questions and receive feedback on their answer within the browser. The quiz is timed and 10 seconds are deducted when a question is answered incorrectly. At the end of the quiz users can enter their names and save their scores, which can then be viewed on the 'Highscores' page.
